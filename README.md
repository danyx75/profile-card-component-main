### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-image: url();
  background-position: right 34vw top 23vh;
}

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Practicing more on my HTML and CSS skills and very soon gonna start practicing JavaScript.

### Useful resources
